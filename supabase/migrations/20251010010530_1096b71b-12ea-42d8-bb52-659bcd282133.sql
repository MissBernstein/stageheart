INSERT requires authentication and verification that recipient has DMs enabled.
UPDATE only allowed by message recipient (for marking as read).
DELETE not permitted (messages are permanent for audit purposes).';

'Restricts message SELECT access to sender and recipient only. Prevents any user from reading others'' private conversations.';
